                <p className='about-p'>The WABOT-1 was the first fun-scale anthropomorphic robot developed in the world. 
                    It consisted of a limb-control system, a vision system and a 
                    conversation system. The WABOT-1 was able to communicate-with a person in Japanese 
                    and to measure distances and directions to the objects using external receptors,
                    artificial ears and eyes, and an artificial mouth. The WABOT-1 walked with his
                    lower limbs and was able to grip and transport objects with hands that used tactile-sensors.
                     It was estimated that the WABOT-1 has the mental faculty of a one-and-half-year-old child.
                      WABOT-1 consisted of the WAM-4 (as its artificial hands) and the WL-5</p>
